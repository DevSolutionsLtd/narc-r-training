##Stats brief
Types of variables

* Quantitative
* Qualitative

Levels of measurement

* Nominal
* Ordinal
* Interval
* Ratio

## categorical Data (Factors)
* Integer values that are mapped to “strings”
* Used to represent categorical data
* Each category is called a level
* One of the most powerful uses of R

## Exercise
* Make a character vector `churchType` using 3 categories – small, medium, large – for 10 churches only.
* Make a factor `churchCategory` by calling the function `factor()` on churchType. 
* Now use `typeof()`, `is.factor`, `is.character`, `is.integer()` to review these 2 objects.

## Grouping data
* tabulation

## Measures of central tendency
* Mean
* Median
* Mode

## Measures of dispersion
* Range, IQR
* Variance, Standard deviation
